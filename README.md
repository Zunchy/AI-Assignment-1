# AI-Assignment-1

This is the submission by Zachary Waterbury for CS-44201 Assignment 1

This project was made in Visual studio, therefore to run the project, open the .sln file in visual studio.

Another way to build and run the code is as follows: on a windows machine with the .net framework installed, open the command prompt and navigate to the directory
that the .cs files are in, then enter the following command: "%SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe" *.cs

This should create an executable of the code called Driver.exe

If this does not work, I have included a built version of the code in the top level of this repository name "BuildAssignment.exe"
